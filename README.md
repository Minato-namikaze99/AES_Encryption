# AES_Encryption
This is an AES Encryption program that I made in Python using the pycryptodome module. 


> P.S. I would recommend running this program in a Virtual Environment to avoid the issue of collision between various modules. You can take a look at [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-virtual-environment/) article to manage Virtual Environments. 

To run this, you only need to install 1 additional module, which can be installed using the following command:

`
pip install pycryptodome
`

Now, run the program!
